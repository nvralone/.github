# never alone (by [pvrz](https://github.com/pvrzz))
Never alone is a small HTML project website with a mission to make a site that aims to provide hotlines, and suicide prevention resources, while providing accessibility shortcuts for those in need of them.

## What the goal of "never alone." is:
We aim to host a lightweight HTML-based resource webpage that loads swiftly.

## This project is still a W.I.P.
This project is still a work in progress, and needs more resources added to the list, as well as a few changes. Until all the resources can be provided, there is a website that shows the FULL list of resources on a 3rd-party website.
