# never alone
Never alone is a small HTML project website with a mission to make a site that aims to provide hotlines, and suicide prevention resources, while providing accessibility shortcuts for those in need of them.

## What the goal of "never alone." is:
We aim to host a webpage that can load faster than most websites, making it easier for slower connections to load the list and get the resources they need.

### This project is still a WIP.
This project is still a work in progress, and needs more resources added to the list, as well as a few changes. Until all the resources can be provided, there is a website that shows the FULL list of resources on a 3rd-party website.
